The tag can also gather other information like device, browser and geographic location (via IP address).\n\nWeb analytics services may also use cookies to track individual sessions and to determine repeat visits from the same browser.\n\nSince some users delete cookies, and browsers have various restrictions around code snippets, no analytics platform can claim full accuracy of their data and different tools sometimes produce slightly different results.\n\n## Sample Web Analytics Data\nWeb analytics data is typically presented in dashboards that can be customized by user persona, date range, and other attributes. Data is broken down into categories, such as:\n\n##\n#### Audience Data\n\n* number of visits, number of unique visitors\n* new vs. returning visitor ratio\n* what country they are from\n* what browser or device they are on (desktop vs. mobile)\n\n##\n#### Audience Behavior\n\n* common landing pages\n* common exit page\n* frequently visited pages\n* length of time spent per visit\n* number of pages per visit\n* bounce rate\n\n##\n## The following are some of the most commonly used tools:\n\n* Google Analytics - the ‘standard’ website analytics tool, free and widely used\n* Piwik - an open-source solution similar in functionality to Google and a popular alternative, allowing companies full ownership and control of their data\n* Adobe Analytics - highly customizable analytics platform (Adobe bought analytics leader Omniture in 2009)\n* Kissmetrics - can zero in on individual behavior, i.e. cohort analysis, conversion and retention at the segment or individual level\n* Mixpanel - advanced mobile and web analytics that measure actions rather than pageviews\n* Parse.ly - offers detailed real-time analytics, specifically for publishers\n* CrazyEgg - measures which parts of the page are getting the most attention using ‘heat mapping’\n* Clicktale - uses ‘heat mapping,’ keystrokes and mouse movement\n\n#\nWith a wide variety of analytics tools on the market, the right vendors for your company’s needs will depend on your specific requirements. Luckily, Optimizely integrates with most of the leading platforms to simplify your data analysis."}]}}}
